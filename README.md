Stardew Valley is an open-ended country-life RPG! You’ve inherited your grandfather’s old farm plot in Stardew Valley. Armed with hand-me-down tools and a few coins, you set out to begin your new life. Can you learn to live off the land and turn these overgrown fields into a thriving home? It won’t be easy. Ever since Joja Corporation came to town, the old ways of life have all but disappeared. The community center, once the town’s most vibrant hub of activity, now lies in shambles. But the valley seems full of opportunity. With a little dedication, you might just be the one to restore Stardew Valley to greatness!

# about
When I was playing the game, I was tired of clicking trough the website to search for certain persons or look up the ingame calendary. That's why I have build a small database based on arraylist and a filter to search up for keywords.
This is a private project but I have gained knowledge from a previous project in my class.

# let's get started
Open "browser" and start the application. There are 3 options.

1: Browse By Likes
2: Browse By Item
3: Browse By Birthday

Meaning of the options:
1: Enter a name to get informations about items which the citizen like or love.
2: Enter a letter or an item name to see a full list of persons who likes it.
3: Enter a letter or name of the month to see when the events/birthday are.
